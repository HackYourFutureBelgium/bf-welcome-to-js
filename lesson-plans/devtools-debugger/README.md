# DevTools Debugger

Practice using different features in your browser's DevTools Debugger to
understand interactive JS programs.

## Objectives

- **Stepping Through**: You can use the _Step_ button to go through a program
  one statement at a time, pausing an any line you want to inspect.
- **Scope Panel**: You can use the _Scope_ panel in your debugger to find the
  value of all active variables at step of execution, including when a variable
  is _uninitialized_.
- **Hovering Previews**: You can preview the value of any expression or
  initialized variable in your program, including parts of a longer expression.
- **Continue to Here**: When paused in the debugger, you can skip the program's
  execution to a specific line using the "continue to here" option.
- **Breakpoints**: Once in the Debugger, you can set and unset breakpoints to
  skip ahead to specific lines. You can also set and unset breakpoints within a
  line when possible.
- **`debugger` Statement**: You understand the difference between `debugger` and
  a breakpoint, and can write a `debugger` statement in your source code to
  pause the program before specific lines.
- **Stepping Over**: You can step over functions in your program to skip their
  _implementation_ and focus on your program's behavior.
