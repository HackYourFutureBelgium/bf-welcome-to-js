// what did you do in this program?
//decalre variables and intailize and after overwrite the values

// what are the final values of `a` and `b`?
// a = 'x'  b = 'y'

// how are they changed from the initial values
//they was assign with another value

// is it possible to swap a and b without using t?
//yes
