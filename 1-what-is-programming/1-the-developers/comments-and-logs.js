/* comments

  comments are for developers to read in the source code
  the computer will ignore them when parsing your program

  you can write multi-line comments like this one
    these are helpful at the top of a program to explain the main idea

  you can also write use single-line comments
    these are helpful for describing what's happening all over the program

  comments are a static help for the developer:
    they exist in the source code but do not influence the program's behavior

/* logs

  logging is one way to look "inside" a program while it's running
  `console.log()` is an instruction written for the computer
  it tells the computer to print something when that line is executed

  when you run the program these messages will be printed to the console
  the developer can read them, but a user will not see them
