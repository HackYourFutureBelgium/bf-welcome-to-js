/* Declaring a Variable

  declaring a variable creates a new "box" in program memory,
    the box will begin empty.

  variable declarations have two main parts:

  - keyword: let, const or var.  (but just let for now)
  - name: a name to help you read the code.
          there are rules about what names you can and can't use
          but that's for later
