/* Declaring and Initializing

  you can also initialize a variable with a value
  this means that the variable will not be empty

  there are four main parts to declaring and initializing:

  - keyword: let, const or var.  (but just let for now)
  - name: a name to help you read the code
  - assignment operator (=)
  - initial value: what you want to store in the variable
