  practice tracing it different ways:
  - use "variables" to check how each variable is used
  - open the code in JS Tutor and step through the program
  - use the "trace" button and read the console output
  - fill out a trace table based on the console output
  - use "highlight" to trace the code by drawing on it

  looking for a challenge? Try the "debug" button
