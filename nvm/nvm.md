depending on the shell you are using `bash` or `zsh` , open a new terminal and
using `ls -la` to show the hidden files, you will have one of those

`.bash_profile, .zshrc, .profile, or .bashrc`

1. open one of the files above using `nano` ex: `nano .zshrc` and paste this at
   the end

```Markdown
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

then `Ctrl + o` and Enter to save the changes and then `Ctrl + x` to exit.

Note : If you are using zsh open `.zshrc` using `nano .zshrc` and add nvm to
