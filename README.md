## Learning Objectives

> all of these skills are limited to short, single-page programs written with
> **Just Enough JavaScript**

### [1. What is Programming](./1-what-is-programming)

What is a program? What is a programming language? How do programs and people
fit together?

- [ ] **Data in, Data Out**: You understand that computer programs are used to
      transform data, and can explain a JS program from this module in terms of
      the data that goes in and the data that comes out.
- [ ] **Three Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is used to
      communicate with 3 different audiences:
- [ ] **Developers**: You can explain how code formatting, comments, logs and
      variable names make it easier (or harder!) for a developer to understand a
      program.
- [ ] **Computers**: You can explain how a computer follows your instructions to
      store, read and modify data in program memory.
- [ ] **Users**: You can explain how the computer creates a dynamic user
      experience by following different executions paths depending on user
      input.
- [ ] **Tracing Variables**: You can complete a trace table for a program that
      uses only variables, and can check your work using the "trace" button.

### [2. Just Enough JavaScript](./2-just-enough-javascript)

Go in depth on JavaScript you need to know for writing interactive text-based
programs in the browser. Along the way you will learn how each language feature
works in small programs.

- [ ] **JavaScript Syntax**: Given a program, you can identify these parts of
      JavaScript syntax:
- [ ] _Primitives_
- [ ] _Operators_
- [ ] _Identifiers_
- [ ] _Keywords_
- [ ] _Checks_
- [ ] _Blocks_
- [ ] _Function Calls_
- **Listening and Reading**: You can read code out loud, and understand your
  classmates when they read code to you. You don't need to understand how a
  program works to master these learning objectives!
- [ ] **Listening** You can exactly re-write a program that a classmate has read
- [ ] **Reading** You can read a program out loud and guide your classmates to
      re-write _exactly_ the same code without them seeing the program. Every
      indentation, semi-colon, comment and spelling in their program must be
      identical to yours.
- [ ] **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: You can explain and use these two ways of
      studying a program, each can help you understand different aspects of your
      code. To help understand this concept, the _options_ panel in Study Lenses
      is organized into _static_ and _dynamic_ study options:
- [ ] **Static**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it. Some
      static study methods are creating a flowchart, analyzing variables,
      filling out a trace table, and drawing on code.
- [ ] **Dynamic**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior. Some
      dynamic study methods are running code and reading console logs, using the
      _trace_ button, and stepping through in the debugger or JS Tutor.
- [ ] **Tracing Execution**: You can complete a "steps" trace table for all JS
      language features in Just Enough JavaScript, and can correct your table
      using console output from the "trace" button.
- [ ] **Analyzing Variables**: You can list all the variables in a program, and
      answer these 5 questions for each variable:
  - _Where is the variable declared?_
  - _What is the variable's scope?_
  - _Is the variable initialized with a value?_
  - _How many times is its value used \(read\) in the program?_
  - _How many times is the variable assigned a new value?_
  - _What types are assigned to this variable during the program's execution?_
- [ ] **Completing Programs**: You can successfully fill in blanks for a program
      when the missing words are provided, including distractors.
- [ ] **Translating Pseudo Code**: Given a program written in Pseudo Code, you
      can translate it to working JavaScript.
- [ ] **Comparing Programs**: You can compare two programs with similar code and
      explain if they have the same behavior or not. If they do not, you can
      explain how they behave differently and why.
- [ ] **Constructing Programs**: You can reconstruct a program's lines and
      indentation, successfully ignoring distractor lines.

### [3. Understanding Programs](./3-understanding-programs)

Learn how to understand a larger programs by finding connections between the
details and the big picture. By the end of this chapter you will know how to
read a new program and do a simple code review.

- [ ] **Stepping Through**: You can pause a script in a your browser's debugger,
      arrange the debugger, collapse extra panels, and step through a script
      written with Just Enough JS. At each point in execution you can make a
      prediction of the next line before executing, and can check your
      prediction using the _scopes_ panel.
- [ ] **Imperative Programming**: You can explain what the Imperative
      Programming paradigm is, and can explain how you know the programs in
      Welcome to JS are Imperative.
- [ ] **Program Goals**: You understand that a full JavaScript program can be
      explained as a series of smaller goals, and can write names for the goals
      in a simple working program.
- [ ] **Logging**: You can tracing specific aspects of a program's execution and
      log them to the console.
- [ ] **Tracing Backwards** You can trace backwards from a program's output to
      it's input.
- [ ] **Naming Variables**: You can analyze how a variable is used in a program
      and give it two names:
  - **Generic**: You can give a generic name to a variable based on how it is
    used in the program.
  - **Specific**: You can give a specific name to a variable based on how it's
    used _and_ the program's domain (the program's specific data and use-case).
- [ ] **Describing Programs**: You can read a program and describe it with
      comments using to the methodology from `/describing-programs`:
  1. Zoom Out
  2. Zoom In
  3. Find Connections
  4. Describe Goals
- [ ] **Code Review**: Given a working program you can review the code for
      clarity, correctness and style.
- [ ] **Same Behavior, Different Code**: You can study simple programs with the
      same behavior (_data in, data out_) but different source code and explain
      how the differences matter for each audience.

### [4. Developing Programs](./4-developing-programs)

Learn to modify and write larger programs in JavaScript. You'll cover many of
the hidden skills necessary to develop quality software and to work
collaboratively on a code base.

- [ ] **Linting**: You can find and fix simple linting errors in JavaScript
      programs.
- [ ] **Program Life Cycle**: You can explain the two phases of a program's life
      cycle.
  1. _Creation Phase_
  2. _Execution Phase_
- [ ] **Fixing Errors**: You can use the structured comment to describe an error
      in your program, and can make several educated guesses at how to fix the
      error.
- [ ] **Fixing Bugs**: You can use the structured comment to describe and fix a
      bug in small programs.
- [ ] **Modifying Programs**: You can make small changes in a program to change
      its behavior without breaking it.
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Given a working program, you can make changes to the code
      without changing the program's behavior.
- [ ] **Writing Programs**: Given a description of a program's behavior (_user
      story + test cases_), you can plan goals for the program and write code to
      pass the tests.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Given a working program with unreadable code, you
  can:
- [ ] Give the program a name.
- [ ] Describe the program's behavior with a user story, acceptance criteria and
      test cases.
- [ ] Plan goals for the program.
- [ ] Develop your own working program with the exact same behavior.
- **Imagining Programs**: Given an empty page, you can imagine and develop your
  own programs using Just Enough JavaScript. This includes:
- [ ] A title.
- [ ] A description with a user story, acceptance criteria and test cases.
- [ ] Commented goals.
- [ ] Fully working Code.

## Code Quality Scripts

This repository comes with some scripts to check the quality of this code. You
can run these scripts to check the code provided by HYF, and to check the code
you write when experiment with the examples and complete the exercises.

### `npm run format`

This script will format all of the code in this repository making sure that all
the indentations are correct, the code is easy to read, and letting you know if
there are any syntax errors.

### `npm run spell-check`

This script will check all of the files in your repository for spelling
mistakes. Spelling is not just a detail, is important! Good spelling helps
others read and understand your programs with less effort.

`spell-check` is not so clever though, it doesn't have _all_ possible words in
it's dictionary and it won't know if you _wanted_ to spell a word incorrectly.
If you think one of it's "Unknown word"s is not a problem, you can either ignore
the suggestion or add the word to the `"words": [ ... ],` list in
[.cspell.json](./.cspell.json).

### `npm run lint:md`

This script will [lint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) all
the Markdown files in this repository, checking for syntax mistakes and other
bad practices. Fixing linting errors will help you learn to write better code by
pointing out your mistakes _before_ they cause problems in your program.

Some linting errors will take some practice to understand and fix, but it will
be a good use of time.

### `npm run lint:js -- ./path/to/code`

Just like `lint:md`, but for `.js` files. This script will lint all of the JS
files in this repository, letting you know if there are any syntax errors or bad
practices.
